# MSIS Final Project
This repo is for our Final Project, the OCFR Case.

## Our Project: Build a Fire-fighter Certificate Management System

This project will allow the user to add, update and delete various persons in the Oconee Country Fire Rescue volunteer organization. 
We will have certain sample data input in our Person table, Certification table as well as the Certification Tracking table. 

Person's are identified by their ID, with attributes like firstname, lastname, stationnumber, radionumber, email adddress etc. 
Certificates are identified by their ID, with attributes like certificate agency, certificate name and default expiration date. 

We will allow the user to:
1) View multiple reports of lists of people filtered by certifications, radionumber, stationnumber etc.
2) Add, update and delete various records of persons and certificates
3) More detailed views of the person and certificate, including appropriate lists for each
